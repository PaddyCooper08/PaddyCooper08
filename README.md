## 🌠 My Projects:
####  [Rideshare](https://github.com/PaddyCooper08/rideshare) 🚗, Uber style app created for a school competitition to encourage ridesharing. I wrote the code while my friend did design work in figma. My first proper website that I did with no youtube tutorials.

#### [Simple email server](https://github.com/PaddyCooper08/emailServer) 📨, Built out of necessity for Rideshare. A simple expressjs server with nodemailer and sendinblue

#### [Zygote](https://github.com/PaddyCooper08/Zygote-discord.py) 🤖, One of my first ever projects -  a catch-all discord bot which started as an rpg but expanded into a music and moderation bot. This was when I was very new to coding and it is done very badly but it works.

#### [Recycling-Identifier](https://github.com/PaddyCooper08/recycling-identifier) ♻, The last python project I worked on. I made this for a raspberry pi competition in the UK and won a raspberry pi pico! This was my first crack at machine learning and could identify the triangles on plastic to tell you if it was recyclable or not.

#### [Security Camera](https://github.com/PaddyCooper08/SecurityCam) 📸, A Python machine learning security camera that was a tutorial at first but then I expanded it with new methods of notifiying me through email and ifttt.

#### [Block Party](https://github.com/PaddyCooper08/Block-party) 🎶, My last project before I took a break from coding .

#### [Flappy AI](https://github.com/PaddyCooper08/FlappyAi) 🐔, The project that got me into machine learning. Flappy bird created with pygame but with a NEAT algorithm teaching the game how to play itself.
