# üí´ About Me:
Hello, I'm Paddy.<br><br>I'm a student in the UK and I like coding in javascript (vue) as well as python.<br>I like tinkering with linux and the raspberry pi and would like to make a proper homelab/server when I have a bigger budget.<br>I enjoy various sports such as rugby, hockey, cricket, tennis and badminton.<br>I also enjoy playing Valorant and Pokemon with friends.<br>

## üå† My Projects:
####  [Rideshare](https://github.com/PaddyCooper08/rideshare) üöó, Uber style app created for a school competitition to encourage ridesharing. I wrote the code while my friend did design work in figma. My first proper website that I did with no youtube tutorials.

#### [Simple email server](https://github.com/PaddyCooper08/emailServer) üì®, Built out of necessity for Rideshare. A simple expressjs server with nodemailer and sendinblue

#### [Zygote](https://github.com/PaddyCooper08/Zygote-discord.py) ü§ñ, One of my first ever projects -  a catch-all discord bot which started as an rpg but expanded into a music and moderation bot. This was when I wasa very new to coding and it is down very badly but it works.

#### [Recycling-Identifier](https://github.com/PaddyCooper08/recycling-identifier) ‚ôª, The last python project I worked on. I made this for a raspberry pi competition in the UK and won a raspberry pi pico! This was my first crack at machine learning and could identify the triangles on plastic to tell you if it was recycable or not.

#### [Security Camera](https://github.com/PaddyCooper08/SecurityCam) üì∏, A Python machine learning security camera that was a tutorial at first but then I expanded it with new methods of notifiying me through email and ifttt.

#### [Block Party](https://github.com/PaddyCooper08/Block-party) üé∂, My last project in tutorial hell before I took a break from coding and came back better and without tutorials.

#### [Flappy AI](https://github.com/PaddyCooper08/FlappyAi) üêî, The project that got me into machine learning. Flappy bird created with pygame but with a NEAT algorithm teaching the game how to play itself.
